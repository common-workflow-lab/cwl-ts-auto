/**
 * Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#Workflow
 *
 * A workflow describes a set of **steps** and the **dependencies** between
 * those steps.  When a step produces output that will be consumed by a
 * second step, the first step is a dependency of the second step.
 * 
 * When there is a dependency, the workflow engine must execute the preceding
 * step and wait for it to successfully produce output before executing the
 * dependent step.  If two steps are defined in the workflow graph that
 * are not directly or indirectly dependent, these steps are **independent**,
 * and may execute in any order or execute concurrently.  A workflow is
 * complete when all steps have been executed.
 * 
 * Dependencies between parameters are expressed using the `source`
 * field on [workflow step input parameters](#WorkflowStepInput) and
 * `outputSource` field on [workflow output
 * parameters](#WorkflowOutputParameter).
 * 
 * The `source` field on each workflow step input parameter expresses
 * the data links that contribute to the value of the step input
 * parameter (the "sink").  A workflow step can only begin execution
 * when every data link connected to a step has been fulfilled.
 * 
 * The `outputSource` field on each workflow step input parameter
 * expresses the data links that contribute to the value of the
 * workflow output parameter (the "sink").  Workflow execution cannot
 * complete successfully until every data link connected to an output
 * parameter has been fulfilled.
 * 
 * ## Workflow success and failure
 * 
 * A completed step must result in one of `success`, `temporaryFailure` or
 * `permanentFailure` states.  An implementation may choose to retry a step
 * execution which resulted in `temporaryFailure`.  An implementation may
 * choose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate
 * immediately upon `permanentFailure`.
 * 
 * * If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then
 * the workflow status is `permanentFailure`.
 * 
 * * If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps
 * complete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is
 * `temporaryFailure`.
 * 
 * * If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the
 * workflow status is `success`.
 * 
 * # Extensions
 * 
 * [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) and
 * [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) are
 * available as standard [extensions](#Extensions_and_Metadata) to core
 * workflow semantics.
