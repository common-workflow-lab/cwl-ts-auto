/**
 * Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#NetworkAccess
 *
 * Indicate whether a process requires outgoing IPv4/IPv6 network
 * access.  Choice of IPv4 or IPv6 is implementation and site
 * specific, correct tools must support both.
 * 
 * If `networkAccess` is false or not specified, tools must not
 * assume network access, except for localhost (the loopback device).
 * 
 * If `networkAccess` is true, the tool must be able to make outgoing
 * connections to network resources.  Resources may be on a private
 * subnet or the public Internet.  However, implementations and sites
 * may apply their own security policies to restrict what is
 * accessible by the tool.
 * 
 * Enabling network access does not imply a publicly routable IP
 * address or the ability to accept inbound connections.
