/**
 * Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#ResourceRequirement
 *
 * Specify basic hardware resource requirements.
 * 
 * "min" is the minimum amount of a resource that must be reserved to
 * schedule a job. If "min" cannot be satisfied, the job should not
 * be run.
 * 
 * "max" is the maximum amount of a resource that the job shall be
 * allocated. If a node has sufficient resources, multiple jobs may
 * be scheduled on a single node provided each job's "max" resource
 * requirements are met. If a job attempts to exceed its resource
 * allocation, an implementation may deny additional resources, which
 * may result in job failure.
 * 
 * If both "min" and "max" are specified, an implementation may
 * choose to allocate any amount between "min" and "max", with the
 * actual allocation provided in the `runtime` object.
 * 
 * If "min" is specified but "max" is not, then "max" == "min"
 * If "max" is specified by "min" is not, then "min" == "max".
 * 
 * It is an error if max < min.
 * 
 * It is an error if the value of any of these fields is negative.
 * 
 * If neither "min" nor "max" is specified for a resource, use the default values below.

   * algorithm that one core can be allocated to multiple
   * jobs. For example, a value of 0.25 indicates that up to 4
   * jobs may run in parallel on 1 core.  A value of 1.25 means
   * that up to 3 jobs can run on a 4 core system (4/1.25 â‰ˆ 3).
   * 
   * Processes can only share a core allocation if the sum of each
   * of their `ramMax`, `tmpdirMax`, and `outdirMax` requests also
   * do not exceed the capacity of the node.
   * 
   * Processes sharing a core must have the same level of isolation
   * (typically a container or VM) that they would normally have.
   * 
   * The reported number of CPU cores reserved for the process,
   * which is available to expressions on the CommandLineTool as
   * `runtime.cores`, must be a non-zero integer, and may be
   * calculated by rounding up the cores request to the next whole
   * number.
   * 
   * Scheduling systems may allocate fractional CPU resources by
   * setting quotas or scheduling weights.  Scheduling systems that
   * do not support fractional CPUs may round up the request to the
   * next whole number.
