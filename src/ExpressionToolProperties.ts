 * An ExpressionTool is a type of Process object that can be run by itself

 * access to the same input parameters as a workflow. It is meant to be used
 * sparingly as a way to isolate complex Javascript expressions that need to
 * operate on input data and produce some result; perhaps just a
 * rearrangement of the inputs. No Docker software container is required
 * or allowed.
