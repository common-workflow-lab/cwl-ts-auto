/**
 * Auto-generated interface for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#WorkflowStep
 *
 * A workflow step is an executable element of a workflow.  It specifies the
 * underlying process implementation (such as `CommandLineTool` or another
 * `Workflow`) in the `run` field and connects the input and output parameters
 * of the underlying process to workflow parameters.
 * 
 * # Scatter/gather
 * 
 * To use scatter/gather,
 * [ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) must be specified
 * in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
 * 
 * A "scatter" operation specifies that the associated workflow step or
 * subworkflow should execute separately over a list of input elements.  Each
 * job making up a scatter operation is independent and may be executed
 * concurrently.
 * 
 * The `scatter` field specifies one or more input parameters which will be
 * scattered.  An input parameter may be listed more than once.  The declared
 * type of each input parameter is implicitly becomes an array of items of the
 * input parameter type.  If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes
 * a nested array.  As a result, upstream parameters which are connected to
 * scattered parameters must be arrays.
 * 
 * All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays.  Each job
 * in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.
 * 
 * If any scattered parameter runtime value is an empty array, all outputs are
 * set to empty arrays and no work is done for the step, according to
 * applicable scattering rules.
 * 
 * If `scatter` declares more than one input parameter, `scatterMethod`
 * describes how to decompose the input into a discrete set of jobs.
 * 
 *   * **dotproduct** specifies that each of the input arrays are aligned and one
 *       element taken from each array to construct each job.  It is an error
 *       if all input arrays are not the same length.
 * 
 *   * **nested_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
 *       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
 *       output must be nested arrays for each level of scattering, in the
 *       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
 * 
 *   * **flat_crossproduct** specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs,
 *       producing a job for every combination of the scattered inputs.  The
 *       output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise listed in the
 *       order that the input arrays are listed in the `scatter` field.
 * 
 * # Conditional execution (Optional)
 * 
 * Conditional execution makes execution of a step conditional on an
 * expression.  A step that is not executed is "skipped".  A skipped
 * step produces `null` for all output parameters.
 * 
 * The condition is evaluated after `scatter`, using the input object
 * of each individual scatter job.  This means over a set of scatter
 * jobs, some may be executed and some may be skipped.  When the
 * results are gathered, skipped steps must be `null` in the output
 * arrays.
 * 
 * The `when` field controls conditional execution.  This is an
 * expression that must be evaluated with `inputs` bound to the step
 * input object (or individual scatter job), and returns a boolean
 * value.  It is an error if this expression returns a value other
 * than `true` or `false`.
 * 
 * Conditionals in CWL are an optional feature and are not required
 * to be implemented by all consumers of CWL documents.  An
 * implementation that does not support conditionals must return a
 * fatal error when attempting to execute a workflow that uses
 * conditional constructs the implementation does not support.
 * 
 * # Subworkflows
 * 
 * To specify a nested workflow as part of a workflow step,
 * [SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) must be
 * specified in the workflow or workflow step requirements.
 * 
 * It is a fatal error if a workflow directly or indirectly invokes itself as
 * a subworkflow (recursive workflows are not allowed).
