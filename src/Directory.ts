/**
 * Auto-generated class implementation for https://w3id.org/cwl/cwl#Directory
 *
 * Represents a directory to present to a command line tool.
 * 
 * Directories are represented as objects with `class` of `Directory`.  Directory objects have
 * a number of properties that provide metadata about the directory.
 * 
 * The `location` property of a Directory is a URI that uniquely identifies
 * the directory.  Implementations must support the file:// URI scheme and may
 * support other schemes such as http://.  Alternately to `location`,
 * implementations must also accept the `path` property on Directory, which
 * must be a filesystem path available on the same host as the CWL runner (for
 * inputs) or the runtime environment of a command line tool execution (for
 * command line tool outputs).
 * 
 * A Directory object may have a `listing` field.  This is a list of File and
 * Directory objects that are contained in the Directory.  For each entry in
 * `listing`, the `basename` property defines the name of the File or
 * Subdirectory when staged to disk.  If `listing` is not provided, the
 * implementation must have some way of fetching the Directory listing at
 * runtime based on the `location` field.
 * 
 * If a Directory does not have `location`, it is a Directory literal.  A
 * Directory literal must provide `listing`.  Directory literals must be
 * created on disk at runtime as needed.
 * 
 * The resources in a Directory literal do not need to have any implied
 * relationship in their `location`.  For example, a Directory listing may
 * contain two files located on different hosts.  It is the responsibility of
 * the runtime to ensure that those files are staged to disk appropriately.
 * Secondary files associated with files in `listing` must also be staged to
 * the same Directory.
 * 
 * When executing a CommandLineTool, Directories must be recursively staged
 * first and have local values of `path` assigned.
 * 
 * Directory objects in CommandLineTool output must provide either a
 * `location` URI or a `path` property in the context of the tool execution
 * runtime (local to the compute node, or within the executing container).
 * 
 * An ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using
 * the same value for `location`.
 * 
 * Name conflicts (the same `basename` appearing multiple times in `listing`
 * or in any entry in `secondaryFiles` in the listing) is a fatal error.
