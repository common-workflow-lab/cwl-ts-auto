 * Define a list of files and subdirectories that must be staged by the workflow platform prior to executing the command line tool.
 * Normally files are staged within the designated output directory. However, when running inside containers, files may be staged at arbitrary locations, see discussion for [`Dirent.entryname`](#Dirent). Together with `DockerRequirement.dockerOutputDirectory` it is possible to control the locations of both input and output files when running in containers.
